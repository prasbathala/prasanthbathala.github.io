<span style="font-weight:500; font-size: 25px" >  Hello there! </span>

I am a graduate student at the [Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech)](https://www.gatech.edu/) where I am pursuing the Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering with specialization in Machine Learning and AI. Additionally, I am currently involved in research at two labs on campus. <br>

At [Pathology Dynamics Lab](https://sites.gatech.edu/cassie-mitchell-lab/) at Georgia Tech where I am working on Biomedical Information Extraction using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques under the guidance of [Prof. Cassie Mitchell](https://sites.gatech.edu/cassie-mitchell-lab/people/pi-profile/). <br>

I am also doing research at the [Janus Laboratory](https://sites.gatech.edu/liaolab/) with [Dr. Hsiao-Wen Liao](https://sites.gatech.edu/liaolab/people/director/), where I am analyzing the sentiment of cultural events and creating tools to help visualize sentiment among different groups. <br>

Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I worked with [Infosys Limited](https://www.infosys.com/) as a Software Engineer in Retail Consumer Logistics division, where I am responsible for automating the complete work flow of generating CRUD reports for migration of an application from Mainframe systems to SAP. I was also involved in Interface Enhancement team. Before that, I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Electrical and Electronics (Silver Medal) at [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://www.amrita.edu/), where I was involved in research with [Dr. K. Deepa](https://www.amrita.edu/faculty/k-deepa). <br>
