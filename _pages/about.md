<span style="font-weight:500; font-size: 25px" >  Hello there! </span>

I am a graduate student at the [Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech)](https://www.gatech.edu/) where I am pursuing the Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering with specialization in Machine Learning and AI. I am also a part of the [Pathology Dynamics Lab](https://sites.gatech.edu/cassie-mitchell-lab/) at Georgia Tech where I am working on Biomedical Information Extraction using NLP techniques under the guidance of [Prof. Cassie Mitchell](https://sites.gatech.edu/cassie-mitchell-lab/people/pi-profile/). I am also involved in research at [Janus Laboratory] (https://sites.gatech.edu/liaolab/) where I am anlyzing the sentiment of cultural events and developing tools to better visualize the sentiment among the groups under the supervision of [Dr. Hsiao-Wen Liao](https://sites.gatech.edu/liaolab/people/director/). <br>



Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
